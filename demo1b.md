# Demo: Create a static HTML web app by using Azure Cloud Shell

In this demo you'll learn how to perform the following actions:

* Deploy a basic HTML+CSS site to Azure App Service by using the `az  webapp up` command
* Update and redeploy the app

The `az webapp up` command does the following actions:

* Create a default resource group.
* Create a default app service plan.
* Create an app with the specified name.
* Zip deploy files from the current working directory to the web app.

## Prerequisites

This demo is performed in the Cloud Shell using the Bash environment.

### Login to Azure

1. Login to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open open the cloud shell.

2. Be sure to select the **Bash** environment.

## Download the sample

1. In the Cloud Shell, create a *demo* directory and then change to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir demoHTML

    cd $HOME/demoHTML
    ```

2. Run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your *demoHTML* directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
    ```

## Create the web app

1. Change to the directory that contains the sample code and run the `az webapp up` command. In the following example, replace `<app_name>` with a unique app name, and `<region>` with a region near you.

    ```bash
    cd html-docs-hello-world

    az webapp up -n <app_name> -l <region> --html
    ```

    This command may take a few minutes to run. While running, it displays information similar to the example below. Make a note of the `resourceGroup` value. You need it for the clean up resources section.

    ```json
    {
    "app_url": "https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net",
    "location": "westeurope",
    "name": "<app_name>",
    "os": "Windows",
    "resourcegroup": "appsvc_rg_Windows_westeurope",
    "serverfarm": "appsvc_asp_Windows_westeurope",
    "sku": "FREE",
    "src_path": "/home/<username>/demoHTML/html-docs-hello-world ",
    < JSON data removed for brevity. >
    }
    ```

2. Open a browser and navigate to the app URL (`http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`) and verify the app is running. Leave the browser open on the app for the next section.

## Update and redeploy the app

1. In the Cloud Shell, type `nano index.html` to open the nano text editor. In the `<h1>` heading tag, change "Azure App Service - Sample Static HTML Site" to "Azure App Service".

2. Use the commands **^O** to save and **^X** to exit.

3. Redeploy the app with the same `az webapp up` command. Be sure to use the same *region* and *app_name* as you used earlier. 

    ```bash
    az webapp up --location <region> --name <app_name>
    ```

4. Once deployment is completed switch back to the browser from step 2 in the "Create the web app" section above and refresh the page.


## Clean up resources

1. After completing the demo you can delete the resources you created using the resource group name you noted in step 1 of the "Create the web app" section above.

    ```bash
    az group delete --name <resource_group> --no-wait
    ```
